# ERP-365Trip

## Project Overview
ERP-365Trip is a full-stack web application designed to provide a simple and efficient platform for managing travel itineraries and bookings. It utilizes a modern tech stack, including a backend API built with Node.js and MongoDB, and a responsive frontend served via Nginx. The application is containerized using Docker for easy deployment and scalability.

## Installation

To get started with the ERP-365Trip application, you'll need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine. Follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash

   cd erp-365trip
   ```

2. **Build and Start the Services**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This command will build the Docker images and start the containers for the backend, frontend, MongoDB, and Mongo Express.

## Usage

Once the containers are up and running, you can access the following services:

- **Frontend**: Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to use the ERP-365Trip web application.
- **Backend API**: The backend can be accessed at `http://localhost:3000`.
- **Mongo Express**: For a web-based MongoDB management interface, visit `http://localhost:8081`. You will need the following credentials:
